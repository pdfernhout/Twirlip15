Why not just user original design (from around 1982 or earlier)?

* Having everything in one big file (or three) makes it hard to backup efficiently with rsync or TimeMachine.

* Using binary data for pointers (not plain text) risks one bit flip messing up everything.

* Hard to do distributed multi-user without UUIDs (versus local positions).

* Hard to find objects if they require searching on multiple fields, like finding an object with type email from a specific sender.

* Hard to search on ranges, like find every email sent in a date range.

* In general, triple concept ignores idea of n-ary tuples (or objects) like shipment of X sent from Y to Z on date D by shipper S (unless you just use triples to build objects or records).

* Can't do arbitrary full-text search.

* Have to lookup abstractions to use as accessors.

* Conflict between single value C fields and multiple value C fields.

* How reliable will it be?

* Limited search options in general compared to SQL or SPARQL or similar.

* Don't like idea of modifying a file other than appending (if need to update index files).

* Had conflict between using system as a library (like SQLite) versus using it as a server (like PostgreSQL).

* Issue where search on BC and get triples matching that were overridden by later triples.

* No way to delete data (you can at best only build application that ignore data marked in some way).

Some of these have workarounds but not all of them.
