export const helpText = `Dialogue Mapping™ is a radically inclusive facilitation process 
that creates a diagram or 'map' that captures and connects participants' comments 
as a meeting conversation unfolds. 
It is especially effective with highly complex or “Wicked” problems 
that are wrought with both social and technical complexity, 
as well as a sometimes maddening inability to move forward in a meaningful and cost effective way.
Dialogue Mapping™ creates forward progress in situations that have been stuck; it clears the way for robust decisions that last.
It is effective because it works with the non-linear way 
humans really think, communicate, and make decisions.

IBIS has four elements:

    * Question -- Unanswered questions to explore
    * Idea -- Potential answer to a question
    * Pro -- Statement which supports an idea
    * Con -- Statement which removes support for an idea

Questions can go under anything. Ideas go under questions. Pros and Cons go under Ideas.

Seven question types (alternative to journalistic: who, what, where, when, why, how, how much):

    * Deontic -- What should we do?
    * Instrumental -- How should we do it?
    * Criteria -- What are the criteria?
    * Meaning/Conceptual -- Do we define the term (or problem) the same way?
    * Factual -- What are the facts here?
    * Background -- What is the context of the situation?
    * Stakeholder -- Who are the stakeholders of this problem?
