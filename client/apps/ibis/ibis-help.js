export const helpText = `Why is Dialogue Mapping useful?
> Dialogue Mapping™ is a radically inclusive facilitation process
that creates a diagram or 'map' that captures and connects participants' comments
as a meeting conversation unfolds.
It is especially effective with highly complex or “Wicked” problems
that are wrought with both social and technical complexity,
as well as a sometimes maddening inability to move forward in a meaningful and cost effective way.
Dialogue Mapping™ creates forward progress in situations that have been stuck;
it clears the way for robust decisions that last.
It is effective because it works with the non-linear way
humans really think, communicate, and make decisions.  
The above is from: http://cognexus.org/id41.htm

What are the four elements of IBIS?  
> Question: Unanswered questions to explore  

> Idea: Potential answer to a question (also sometimes called an "option")  

> Pro: Statement which supports an idea  

> Con: Statement which reduces support for an idea  


What is the grammar of IBIS?  

> The starting point is a Question.  

> Ideas go under Questions.  

> Pros and Cons go under Ideas.  

> Questions can go under anything.  

What are the eight main question types (as an alternative to journalistic: who, what, where, when, why, how, how much)?  

> Deontic: "What should we do?"  

> Instrumental: "How should we do it?"  

> Criteria: "What are the criteria?"  (like for judging success)

> Meaning/Conceptual: "Do we define the term (or problem) the same way?"  

> Factual: "What are the facts here?"  

> Background: "What is the context of the situation?"  

> Stakeholder: "Who are the stakeholders of this problem?"  

> Future: "What might happen in the future?"

What are other ways to distinguish questions?  

> Closed questions  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ have only a few possible specific easy-to-understand answers (like yes/no)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- tend to limit conversation to a narrow focus which may miss key ideas  

> Open questions  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ can lead to any sort of answer or idea  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ tend to expand conversation for find better solutions  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- may take a lot of time to explore

What is a "left-hand move"?
> Someone may ask a question about the context of the discussion, like "Maybe we should be talking about X instead?".
In that case, you can make a question above (to the left of) the current top-level starting question as a new root of the IBIS hierarchy.
This "left-hand move" then pushes everything else to the right.

What is the format of this help?
> This help is in itIBIS format (indented text IBIS) useable with any text editor as opposed to gIBIS format (graphical IBIS) used by Compendium.
One exception from itIBIS format of having one answer per line is having ideas on multiple lines with these longer answers separated by blank lines.
