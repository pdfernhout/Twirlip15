export const helpText = `IBIS has four elements:

    * Question -- Unanswered questions to explore
    * Idea -- Potential answer to a question
    * Pro -- Statement which supports an idea
    * Con -- Statement which removes support for an idea

Seven question types (alternative to journalistic: who, what, where, when, why, how, how much):

    * Deontic -- What should we do?
    * Instrumental -- How should we do it?
    * Criteria -- What are the criteria?
    * Meaning/Conceptual -- Do we define the term (or problem) the same way?
    * Factual -- What are the facts here?
    * Background -- What is the context of the situation?
    * Stakeholder -- Who are the stakeholders of this problem?
