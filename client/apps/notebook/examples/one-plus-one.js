// You can click the "Print it" button to print the result of evaluating the "1+1" expression below.
// The result is printed directly into the editor window at the end, modifying the text.

// If you select only part of the expression, like "1" and click "Print it", 
// only the selected part is evaluated and printed right after the selection.

// The result is the new selection, so you can press backspace to delete it.
// You can also click "Undo" to remove the next text.

// Usually when you make changes in the editor you would want to click the "Save" button to make a new snippet for them.
// But, you don't usually want to do that when you are just looking around.
// If you don't remove the changed text before clicking "Next", 
// the editor will warn you about unsaved changes when you try go to the next snippet.
// You can just click "OK" for now to proceed when you see that alert pop up.
