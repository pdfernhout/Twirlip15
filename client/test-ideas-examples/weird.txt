Inspired by a reference to a "weird file" by Lion Kimbro:

Thinking: what if used plain text to keep all notes in one file?
Like "clippings" file from Kindle, but manually maintained and improvable.

What if you had a tool to start a note with a format template including a UUID?

And what if you had another tool to display the file in interesting ways?

Examples below.

Another note.

Not much to see here. Move along. Move along. :-)
