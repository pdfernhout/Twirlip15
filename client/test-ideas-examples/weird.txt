Inspired by a reference to a "weird file" by Lion Kimbro:

Thinking: what if used plain text to keep all notes in one file?
Like "clippings" file from Kindle, but manually maintained and improvable.

What if you had a tool to start a note with a format template including a UUID?

And what if you had another tool to display the file in interesting ways?

Examples below.

Another note.

Not much to see here. Move along. Move along. :-)

Added Smart Notes examples to concept.txt

A reference to a previous note can just be the uuid 
or part of it, like so: note|ea0ff97e-bbc2-44c7-9030-e3dd47357c8a

You could refer to a specific version of a note by using the sha256 hash of the content.

Another note (which has been updated, which you can tell because the UUID is the same).

Not much to see here. Move along! Move along! :-)

Made shell script to generate separators:
    $ cat sep.sh 
    echo "======== note|"`uuid` `date -Isec -u`

Reading: "Knowledge synthesis: A conceptual model and practical guide" by Joel Chan
https://oasislab.pubpub.org/pub/54t0y9mk/release/3

> In this model, we create and update four basic kinds of entities in the synthesis process:
> * Question notes, which express an open research question,
> * Synthesis notes, which express a single, generalized idea, such as a claim,
> * Observation notes, which express a single, highly contextualized and specific observation that, together with other observation notes, can form the basis of a synthesis note, and
> * Context snippet notes, which help to ground and contextualize observation notes.
> ...
> There is a hierarchical relationship between the artifacts: question and synthesis notes (at the top "layer") are supported/opposed/informed by one or more observation notes (at the middle "layer"), which are substantiated/contextualized by one or more context snippet notes (at the bottom "layer"). 
> Synthesis notes can also be composed into more complex structures (such as arguments or theories or models) through relations with other synthesis notes that vary in complexity from simple "relates to", to implication/explanation and support/opposition.

Which all makes me think a bit on Dialogue Mapping with IBIS.
