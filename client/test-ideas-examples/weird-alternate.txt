================================================
Inspired by a reference to a "weird file" by Lion Kimbro:
https://users.speakeasy.net/~lion/nb/book.txt
https://web.archive.org/web/20100719135412/https://speakeasy.org/~lion/weird.html

Thinking: what if used plain text to keep all notes in one file?
Like "clippings" file from Kindle, but manually maintained and improvable.

What if you had a tool to start a note with a format template including a UUID?

And what if you had another tool to display the file in interesting ways?

Examples below.

@ uuid note|078ebccdd-d1af-4824-a5c0-453a1d7725a7
@ timestamp 2022-08-12T02:55:39Z
@ sha256 7bd4cbb175cb52d17efab2d819182647d4d1eafe39f87ac1cd36d1a07b26cc1c
================================================ 
Another note.

Not much to see here. Move along. Move along. :-)

@ uuid note|136ba090-99fd-40da-a91a-d6d64362e02e
@ timestamp 2022-08-12T02:57:21Z

Continuing to read "How to Take Smart Notes"

@ uuid note|ea0ff97e-bbc2-44c7-9030-e3dd47357c8a
@ timestamp 2022-08-12T03:01:39Z
@ sha256 7bd4cbb175cb52d17efab2d819182647d4d1eafe39f87ac1cd36d1a07b26cc1c
================================================
Added Smart Notes examples to concept.txt

A reference to a previous note can just be the uuid 
or part of it, like so: note|ea0ff97e-bbc2-44c7-9030-e3dd47357c8a
or perhaps (less precisely): note|ea0ff97e

You could refer to a specific version of a note by using the sha256 hash of the content.

@ uuid note|fbe67236-1416-44ec-813e-d6ddd4e41010
@ timestamp 2022-08-13T23:30:41.311Z
@ sha256 7bd4cbb175cb52d17efab2d819182647d4d1eafe39f87ac1cd36d1a07b26cc1c
================================================
Another note (which has been updated, which you can tell because the UUID is the same).

Not much to see here. Move along! Move along! :-)

@ uuid note|136ba090-99fd-40da-a91a-d6d64362e02e
@ timestamp 2022-08-13T23:34:50.069Z

================================================
Made shell script to generate separators:
    $ cat sep.sh 
    echo "================================================ note|"`uuid` `date -Isec -u`
